## CURRENT DEPLOYMENT ISSUE - CRITICAL

### ❌ URGENT: GitHub Actions Deployment Not Reflecting Source Code Changes
**Status:** Website live at https://www.violadoula.com but showing OLD content despite successful deployments

### Recent Changes Made (August 25, 2025):
1. ✅ **Removed testimonials** from About.tsx (placeholder testimonials eliminated)
2. ✅ **Updated pricing packages**:
   - Basic Birth Support: $800 → $1,300 (1 prenatal, continuous phone/text support, labor support, 1 postpartum, birth plan creation)
   - Complete Birth Experience: $1,200 → $1,500 (2 prenatal, continuous phone/text support, labor support, 2 postpartum, birth plan creation)
   - Removed Postpartum Care Package entirely
   - Full Spectrum → "Complete Birth Experience + HypnoBirthing®": $1,600 → $1,800 (Complete package + HypnoBirthing® training)
3. ✅ **Updated translations** in both en.json and es.json files
4. ✅ **Source files correctly updated** - verified in repository
5. ✅ **Local builds successful** - npm run build works correctly
6. ✅ **GitHub Actions deployments successful** - no errors in workflow runs

### Problem Details:
- **Live website still shows:** 4 packages with old pricing ($800, $1,200, $600, $1,600)
- **Live website still shows:** Testimonials section in About page
- **Live website still shows:** "Vite + React + TS" title
- **Confirmed on multiple devices/browsers:** Chrome, Brave, desktop, mobile - all show old content
- **GitHub repository:** All source files correctly updated (commits 4a7ca2a, 28c2428, 98f2b9e)
- **GitHub Actions:** All deployment runs successful (Deploy to GitHub Pages workflow)

### Troubleshooting Attempted:
- ✅ Hard refresh, cache clearing, incognito mode - no effect
- ✅ Multiple device testing - consistent old content
- ✅ Force rebuilds with new hashes - deployments succeed but content unchanged
- ✅ Verified GitHub Actions using source from correct branch (main)
- ✅ Confirmed GitHub Pages set to "GitHub Actions" deployment source
- ✅ DNS configuration working correctly for custom domain

### Current Hypothesis:
GitHub Actions may be building from a cached version or there's a disconnect between the GitHub Actions build process and what's being served. The workflow shows success but the built content doesn't match the source code.

### Next Session Priority:
1. **Investigate GitHub Actions workflow logs** in detail
2. **Check if there's a build cache issue** in the GitHub Actions environment  
3. **Verify the actual deployed assets** match what should be built from source
4. **Consider alternative deployment approach** if GitHub Actions continues to fail silently

## Previous Status: PREMIUM WEBSITE COMPLETE - ALL REQUIREMENTS MET

### ✅ Major Session Achievement - August 27, 2025: Development Environment & Button Functionality

**Complete Solution Implemented:**
1. **Cleaned Development Environment** - Removed all built assets and cache directories
2. **Reset index.html** - Restored to proper development version that loads from `/src/main.tsx`

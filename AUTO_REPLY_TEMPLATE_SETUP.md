## Template Variables

The auto-reply system automatically populates these variables:

|----------|--------|---------------|
| `{{client_name}}` | Form submission | "Sarah Johnson" |
| `{{client_email}}` | Form submission | "sarah@email.com" |
| `{{service_type}}` | Auto-generated | "consultation request" / "HypnoBirthingÂ® enrollment" |
| `{{next_steps}}` | Auto-generated | Custom message based on form type |
| `{{from_name}}` | Static | "Vio La Doula" |
| `{{business_email}}` | Static | "hello@violadoula.com" |
| `{{business_phone}}` | Static | "(713) 234-5678" |
| `{{website_url}}` | Static | "https://www.violadoula.com" |

## Dynamic Content Generation

### Contact Form Auto-Reply
- **Service Type:** "consultation request"
- **Next Steps:** "I will personally review your inquiry and get back to you within 24 hours to schedule your free consultation."

### HypnoBirthingÂ® Enrollment Auto-Reply  
- **Service Type:** "HypnoBirthingÂ® enrollment"
- **Next Steps:** "I will review your enrollment details and send you course materials and payment information within 24 hours."

## Implementation Status

âœ… **Auto-Reply Function Created** - `sendAutoReply()` in `/src/utils/emailService.ts`
âœ… **Contact Form Integration** - Auto-reply triggers after successful contact form submission
âœ… **HypnoBirthing Form Integration** - Auto-reply triggers after successful enrollment submission
âœ… **Template Documentation** - Complete template specification provided
âœ… **Variable Mapping** - All template parameters properly configured

## Technical Implementation

### Function Signature
```typescript
export const sendAutoReply = async (
  clientEmail: string, 
  clientName: string, 
  formType: 'contact' | 'hypnobirthing'
): Promise<boolean>
```

### Form Integration
Both forms now include auto-reply functionality:
- **Contact Form** (`Contact.tsx`): Calls `sendAutoReply(data.email, data.name, 'contact')`
- **HypnoBirthing Form** (`HypnobirthingForm.tsx`): Calls `sendAutoReply(data.email, data.fullName, 'hypnobirthing')`

### Error Handling
- Auto-reply failures are logged but don't prevent form submission success
- If auto-reply fails, the main notification email to the business owner still succeeds
- Graceful degradation ensures core functionality remains intact

## EmailJS Account Requirements

**âœ… ACTIVE:** Paid EmailJS account required for auto-reply functionality
- Free accounts: Limited to 200 emails/month, no auto-reply templates
- Paid accounts: Unlimited templates including auto-reply capability
- Current setup uses paid account with template limits removed

## Setup Instructions for EmailJS Dashboard

1. **Log into EmailJS Dashboard** at https://dashboard.emailjs.com
2. **Navigate to Email Templates**
3. **Create New Template** with ID: `auto_reply_template`
4. **Set Subject:** `Thank you for contacting Vio La Doula!`
5. **Copy Template Content** from above

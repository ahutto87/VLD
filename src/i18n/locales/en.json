    "intro": "I'm Vio &#9825; a bilingual doula, HypnoBirthing® educator, and motherhood coach. I support women and families through pregnancy, birth, and postpartum with calm, confidence, and genuine presence.<br><br>My passion for this work comes from my own experiences: two empowering HypnoBirthing births, one at a birthing center and one at home. These births showed me the strength of the mind-body connection and the importance of compassionate, informed support.<br><br>I believe in the wisdom of your body, the clarity of your mind, and the truth of your heart. My work brings all of this together so you can move through motherhood feeling supported, grounded, and connected to yourself.",
